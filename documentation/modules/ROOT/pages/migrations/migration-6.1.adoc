In this document, we will see the major steps to migrate from 6.0 to 6.1.

NOTE: Please check the {product-version-changelog}[change log] for detailed list of fixes, changes and improvements
introduced in 6.1

== Overriding entity fields

Previously, the code generator replaced the field definition by the new one. It was resulting in potential issues if
some changes were added to the main field between two versions.

Now the code generator will merge initial field attributes with overridable attributes.
So, only necessarily attributes that need to be overridden should be defined in the overwritten entity.

This applies to both entities and enums.

In the case of entity fields, there are a few restrictions:

- Attributes that are not overridable:
  * `initParam`
  * `column`
  * `column2`
  * `ref`
  * `mappedBy`
  * `table`
  * `tz`
  * `json`
- Attributes that are overridable with some conditions:
  * `large`: large field cannot become non-large
  * `transient` and `formula`: persisted field cannot become non-persisted

Transient and multirelational fields that were previously not overridable now are.

== View collaboration

Views collaboration allows to see users that are seeing/editing/updating the current opened record. More information
xref:dev-guide:web-client/collaboration.adoc[here]

This feature can be disabled with `view.collaboration.enabled` property.

== Client-side sorting of o2m/m2m grids

Current o2m/m2m fields sorting is done using HTTP search request. So it was not able to sort such fields when the field
value was dirty (i.e. contains some pending changes).

Now o2m/m2m fields are sorted on client side. So no matter the field contains pending change, it can be sorted (only
restricted when records can be moved). Also dummy and transient fields can be sorted.

== Grid pagination

Previously, we implemented `api.pagination.max-per-page` to define the maximum number of records displayed per page.
Current default behavior is unlimited (but can be changed in configuration file), so a user can change the settings in
grid views and display an unlimited number of records. This is causing serious performance issues on large entities.

Now, the maximum number of records a user can display per page is limited to *500*.

Also, we introduce a new configuration `api.pagination.default-per-page` to define the default number of items
displayed per page. Default value is still 40 records.

== Scale on grid

Changing a field `scale` was effective only on form view. Now, `scale` attribute on a decimal field can be changed on a
grid column by an action.

Also, the `x-scale` attribute now accepts a field name for a dynamic evaluation. Grid and form view are both supported.

[source,xml]
----
<field name="decimalField" widget="Decimal" x-scale="currency.decimalPlaces" x-precision="18"/>
----

== Bound field in InfoButton widget

When using `info-button` widget, the name attribute of the button bind to a real or dummy field. It was causing issues
to change the button attributes and the field attributes separately using `action-attrs`. Moreover, the values displayed
in the button was not formatted according to the field definition.

We introduced `x-field` attribute on `info-button` widget to specify the bound field. When using `x-field`, the button
and the field are 2 distinct elements. Any attributes defined on that field will be used to format the value. Moreover,
this allows to change the button attributes without impact on the bound field.

== Proxy support

Using proxy in front of the application was working but requires adding a few extra configuration on proxy in order to
rewrite the cookie path but also the Location.

We improve support when HTTP requests are forwarded by a proxy server. The following `X-Forwarded-*` headers are supported:
`X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Port`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Prefix`, `X-Forwarded-For`. Redirections will
use these headers. Proxy configuration will be easier as it doesn't require to rewrite the cookie path and the
Location (now returning absolute URLs).

Here is an example based on `Nginx`:

[source,bash]
----
|--------|  https://example.com/my-app   |-------|  http://internal:8080/some  |--------|
| Client |  -------------------------->  | Proxy |  ------------------------>  | Tomcat |
|------- |                               |-------|                             |--------|
----

[source,nginx]
----
location = /my-app {
    return 302 /my-app/;
}

location /my-app/ {

    # Proxy support
    proxy_redirect          off;
    proxy_set_header        Host                $host;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Host    $host;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For     $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto   $scheme;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Port    443;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Prefix  /my-app;

    # WebSocket support
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;

    proxy_pass http://internal:8080/some/;
}
----


[WARNING]
====
Note that following changes:

- `X-Forwarded-Context` support removed in favor of `X-Forwarded-Prefix`.
- The configuration property `auth.provider.xx.absoluteUrlRequired` has been removed.
====

== Dependencies upgrade

Some dependencies have been upgraded to newer versions. Check the {product-version-changelog}[change log] for detailed
list.

Gradle has also been upgraded to a newer version. Upgrade the Gradle Wrapper to benefit from new features and
improvements : `./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 7.5.1`.

[NOTE]
====
Note that running the wrapper task once will update `gradle-wrapper.properties` only, but leave the wrapper itself in
`gradle-wrapper.jar` untouched. This is usually fine as new versions of Gradle can be run even with ancient wrapper
files. If you nevertheless want all the wrapper files to be completely up-to-date, youâ€™ll need to run the `wrapper`
task a second time.
